<p><em><strong>TL;DR: Stop reading this page if you (or anyone related to you)
  intend on suing me if you die, get hurt, and/or horribly lost on a 20 hr day
  epic.</strong></em>

<p><em>Longer disclaimer: Climbing is dangerous. Do your own independent research before

  Some additional things about this page:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ratings are personal ratings. Check a guide book or Mountain Project for
      a more "official" rating.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gear lists are NOT recommendation lists. It is simply a list of what I had with me.
    </li>
    <li>
      All topos are (poorly) hand drawn and definitely not to scale.
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- Start Dolphin -->
<h2 id="202011_dolphin">Dolphin - 5.7 - October 2020 - JTNP, CA</h2>
<p>
  Commentary: Probably the best moderate off-width (is that phrase even legal?) in
  Joshua Tree. Easy climbing from the start to a short but will seem like forever
  off-width section you're either too big or too small for. I'll definitely be back
  for that clean send.
