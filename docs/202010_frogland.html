<p><em><strong>TL;DR: Stop reading this page if you (or anyone related to you)
  intend on suing me if you die, get hurt, horribly lost on a 20 hr day

  Some additional things about this page:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ratings are personal ratings. Check a guide book or Mountain Project for
      a more "official" rating.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gear lists are NOT recommendation lists. It is simply a list of what I had with me.
    </li>
    <li>
      All topos are (poorly) hand drawn and definitely not to scale.
    </li>
  </ul>
