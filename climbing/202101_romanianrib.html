 <h2 id='202101_romanianrib'>Romanian Rib - January 2021 - Red Rock, NV</h2>
 <h3>The basics</h3>
 <p>
   This is a great first route for starting at First Creek. The climb itself is
   low 5th class, but the descent will take some route finding to make sure you
   don't accidentally cliff yourself out and have to backtrack. 70m rope was used
   to rap.
