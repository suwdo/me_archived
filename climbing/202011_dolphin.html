<h2 id="202011_dolphin">Dolphin - 5.7 - October 2020 - JTNP, CA</h2>
<p>
  Commentary: Probably the best moderate off-width (is that phrase even legal?) in
  Joshua Tree. Easy climbing from the start to a short but will seem like forever
  off-width section you're either too big or too small for. I'll definitely be back
  for that clean send.
