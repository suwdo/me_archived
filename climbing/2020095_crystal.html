<h3>The basics</h3>
<p>
  This is probably one of the easiest approach "alpine" climbs you can do, Roughly
  45 minutes from the parking lot to the base. I didn't actually finish all of the
  "summits" of Crystal Crag as I saw a dark cloud in the distance. That "cloud" turned
  out to be one of the Sierra fires in the summer of 2020.
