  <p><em><strong>TL;DR: Stop reading this page if you (or anyone related to you)
    intend on suing me if you die, get hurt, and/or horribly lost on a 20 hr day

  <p><em>Longer disclaimer: Climbing is dangerous. Do your own independent research before

    Some additional things about this page:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ratings are personal ratings. Check a guide book or Mountain Project for
        a more "official" rating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gear lists are NOT recommendation lists. It is simply a list of what I had with me.
      </li>
      <li>
        All topos are (poorly) hand drawn and definitely not to scale.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="#202010_catinthehat">Cat in the Hat - 5.6 - October 2020 - Red Rock, NV</h2>
  <p>
    Commentary: Cat in the hat is a chill, but interesting enough multipitch. Great route to
    familiarize yourself with Red Rock trad multis.
  </p>
  <h3>The basics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal First Ascent: October 30th, 2020</li>
    <li>Party: 3 (single rope with ascender)</li>
    <li>Time: 8 hours car to car</li>
    <li>Rating: 5.6</li>
    <li>Lead: all pitches</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Gear</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Totem: double from blue to purple, single black and green</li>
    <li>C4: double from 1 to 3, single 0.75, 4</li>
    <li>Nuts: none</li>
    <li>Alpine draws: 10</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    Commentary: If you're a somewhat competent climber (e.g. solid Joshua Tree 5.7 climber),
    you won't use half of this gear per pitch, but never hurts to have extras?
