    Some additional things about this page:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ratings are personal ratings. Check a guide book or Mountain Project for
        a more "official" rating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gear lists are NOT recommendation lists. It is simply a list of what I had with me.
      </li>
      <li>
        All topos are (poorly) hand drawn and definitely not to scale.

  <p>
    Commentary: Cat in the hat is a chill, but interesting enough multipitch. Great route to
    familiarize yourself with Red Rock trad multis.

  <h3>The basics</h3>
  <p>
    This is probably one of the easiest approach "alpine" climbs you can do, Roughly
    45 minutes from the parking lot to the base. I didn't actually finish all of the
    "summits" of Crystal Crag as I saw a dark cloud in the distance. That "cloud" turned
    out to be one of the Sierra fires in the summer of 2020.
