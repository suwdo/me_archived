  <p><em><strong>TL;DR: Stop reading this page if you (or anyone related to you)
    intend on suing me if you die, get hurt, and/or horribly lost on a 20 hr day

  <p><em>Longer disclaimer: Climbing is dangerous. Do your own independent research before
    attempting any route. Notes here are for my own use and not intended to be

    Some additional things about this page:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ratings are personal ratings. Check a guide book or Mountain Project for
        a more "official" rating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gear lists are NOT recommendation lists. It is simply a list of what I had with me.
      </li>
      <li>
        All topos are (poorly) hand drawn and definitely not to scale.
      </li>
    </ul>
