<p><em><strong>TL;DR: Stop reading this page if you (or anyone related to you)
  intend on suing me if you die, get hurt, and/or horribly lost on a 20 hr day
  epic.</strong></em>

<p><em>Longer disclaimer: Climbing is dangerous. Do your own independent research before
  attempting any route. Notes here are for my own use and not intended to be
  definitive or "safe" beta of any sort.</em>

  Some additional things about this page:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ratings are personal ratings. Check a guide book or Mountain Project for
      a more "official" rating.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gear lists are NOT recommendation lists. It is simply a list of what I had with me.
    </li>
    <li>
      All topos are (poorly) hand drawn and definitely not to scale.
    </li>
